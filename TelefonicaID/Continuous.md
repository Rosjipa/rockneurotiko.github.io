## 1. Continuous Integration

#### Descripcion: (From Atlassian)

The process of automatically building and testing your software on a regular basis. How regularly this occurs varies; in the early days of agile this meant daily builds, however, with the rise of tools like Bamboo, this can be as often as every commit. In the business systems team we build and run full unit and integration tests of every commit to every branch using Bamboo’s branch-build feature.

## 2. Continuous Deployment

#### Descripcion: (From Atlassian)

The ultimate culmination of this process; it’s the actual delivery of features and fixes to the customer as soon as they are ready. It usually refers to cloud and SaaS, as these are the most amenable to being silently updated in the background. But some desktop software offers this in the form of optional beta and nightly updates such as Mozilla’s beta and aurora Firefox channels, for example.
